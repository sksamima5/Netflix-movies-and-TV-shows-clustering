This Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset contains 7787 observations and 12 features. The dataset is collected from flixable which is third-party Netflix search engine in 2018. They have released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming services number of movies has decreased by more than 2000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. After loading the dataset, firstly, we performed data cleaning, means we found some features with high number of null values. So around 5 features have the null values and we treated accordingly. So, we decided to drop the director attribute. We also deal with the country attribute; some NaN values were found in this attribute and we removed them. After that, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to gain some insights. Various plots and graphs were constructed. Speaking about the insights, we found that in Netflix around 30.95% of the data is belongs to TV Shows and 69.05% contains Movies. With the help of pie chart visualization, we got to know that United States have the maximum content on Netflix followed by India which is in second position. Next step was data preprocessing which was performed on texted data(attributes), i.e., description attribute and listed_in attribute. We come with various approaches to decrease the count or we can say length of the text values in these two attributes by removing stop words, removing punctuation, did stemming and finally applied counter vectorizer on updated text features. And we got really amazing result, the length of the text data in each attribute has been decreased. Now we come with the final step of the project, here, we applied clustering methods to find optimal cluster by using Silhouette Score method and we got the score for 3 number of clusters as 0.348. We also used K Means Clusteringâ€™s Elbow method and the result is K=3. Also, we used K mean clustering, Hierarchical clustering = Dendrogram and Agglomerative. And we concluded that Optimal K cluster for the dataset is 3. After that we did test our project by doing recommendation step, where we are getting nice recommending results.
